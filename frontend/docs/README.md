# Powerhouse Document Model

## Getting started

Install the library:

-   NPM: `npm install @acaldas/document-model-libs`
-   Yarn: `yarn add @acaldas/document-model-libs`

## Documentation

The full documentation for this package is available at: https://acaldas.github.io/document-model-libs/

There are two ways to interact with a document:

### Functional:

```javascript
import {
    actions,
    reducer,
    utils,
} from '@acaldas/document-model-libs/budget-statement';

let budgetStatement = utils.createBudgetStatement({
    name: 'March report',
    data: { month: '2023/01' },
});

budgetStatement = reducer(
    budgetStatement,
    actions.addAccount([{ address: 'eth:0x00' }])
);
```

### Object oriented:

```javascript
import { BudgetStatement } from '@acaldas/document-model-libs/budget-statement';

const budgetStatement = new BudgetStatement({
    name: 'march',
    data: { month: '2023/01' },
});
budgetStatement.addAccount([{ address: 'eth:0x00' }]);
```

## Architecture

This implementation is inspired by the [Flux architecture pattern](https://facebookarchive.github.io/flux/). All state changes are performed by a reducer, which is a pure function that enforces state transitions:

```javascript
const newState = reducer(state, action);
```

The business logic is implemented in pure functions, making it easy to test and integrate into different applications. The operations history is kept to allow reverting changes.

An action is a JSON object with the action name and payload:

```javascript
{
    type: 'SET_NAME';
    input: {
        name: 'March report';
    }
}
```

To make it easier to create actions and avoid bugs, an action creator is provided for each action. This is a function that accepts the action input and returns the JSON structure. For the case above the action creator would be:

```javascript
state = reducer(state, setName('March report'));
```

An Object-oriented version is also provided. A document can be instantiated and interacted in an imperative way:

```javascript
const document = new Document();
document.setName('March report');
```

## Base Document Model

All document models extend the Base Document model, which provides some common features. A document has the following structure:

```javascript
{
    name: "SES 2023-01 expense report", // name of the document
    documentType: "powerhouse/budget-statement", // type of the document model
    revision: 4, // number of operations applied to the document
    created: "2023-02-05 12:15:01", // date of creation of the document
    lastModified: "2023-02-05 12:15:01", // date of the last modification
    data: {} // specific state of the document, to be implemented by document models
}
```

### Base Document Actions

Document reducers are wrapped by the Base Document reducer, which is responsible for updating the document attributes described above and adds support for some base document features.

▸ For more information on Document actions, please refer to the [complete documentation](markdown/modules/Document.actions.md).

-   `SET_NAME`: Changes the name of the document

```javascript
setName(name: string);
```

-   `UNDO`: Cancels the last X operations. Defaults to 1.

```javascript
undo(count: number);
```

-   `REDO`: Cancels the last X UNDO operations. Defaults to 1.

```javascript
redo(count: number);
```

-   `PRUNE`: Joins multiple operations into a single `LOAD_STATE` operation. Useful to keep operations history smaller. Operations to prune are selected by index, similar to the [slice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) method in Arrays.

```javascript
prune(start?: number, end?: number);
```

## Budget Statement Model

A Budget statement follows the following data structure:

```javascript

    name: "SES January 2023",
    documentType: "powerhouse/budget-statement",

### Budget Statement Actions

▸ For more information on Budget Statement actions, please refer to the [complete documentation](markdown/modules/BudgetStatement.actions.md).

#### Account

A budget statement might have multiple accounts, each with its own expenses.

-   `ADD_ACCOUNT`: Adds an account to the budget. This action accepts an array of accounts, so multiple accounts can be added in one action. The account can be initialized with all attributes but the only required attribute is an unique account address, which should follow a Gnosis-like format: `eth:0x...`.

```javascript
addAccount([{ address: string }]);
```

-   `UPDATE_ACCOUNT`: Edits existing accounts. Accounts are referenced by their address.

```javascript
updateAccount([{ address: string, ...account }]);
```

-   `DELETE_ACCOUNT`: Deletes the accounts with the provided addresses.

```javascript
deleteAccount(accounts: string[]);
```

#### Status

The budget goes through various status as it is reviewed by auditors.
It starts as a `Draft` which can then be submitted for `Review`. The auditor then either approves with or raises issues.

-   `SUBMIT_FOR_REVIEW`: Sets the budget as ready to be reviewed.

```javascript
submitForReview();
```

-   `ESCALATE`: Used by the auditor if there is any issue during the review

```javascript
escalate();
```
