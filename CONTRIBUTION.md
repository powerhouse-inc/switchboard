### Testing structure

The test suite is designed to ensure that some of the modules are fully covered by tests.
Therefore, there're 2 runs of tests: one validates that overall code coverage is on appropriate level, another validates that the code coverage for
a subset of modules is maximal.

The coverage report will therefore contain two tables.

See corresponding configs in `./vitest.config.ts` and `./vitest.modules.config.ts`
